# ncl_CMIP_Interpolation
This is a ncl template for CMIP interpolation,  a interpolation based on NCL bag already provided (function_cmip_3D), the interpolation packages can be the CMIP arbitrary 3D climate elements (Time, lat, lon/Level, lat, lon) interpolation, but on 4D climate can not directly use, need to do some improvement

#function_cmip_all 
is a function package that satisfies the interpolation of three and four dimensional variables. When it comes to four-dimensional data, there is still an incompatibility (especially at the layer level), which can be adjusted appropriately according to the specific naming rules of the model
