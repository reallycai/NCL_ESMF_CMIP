# ncl_CMIP_Interpolation
This is a ncl template for CMIP interpolation, and the program
This code is illustrated with an example of SST 
You can make some improvements on this basis to adapt to the actual situation
In order to make the code compatible, A interpolation based on NCL bag already provided (function_cmip_3D), the interpolation packages can be the CMIP arbitrary 3D climate elements (Time, lat, lon/Level, lat, lon) interpolation, but on 4D climate can not directly use, need to do some improvement
